# Application of HSI in the field of Finnish rock art and pigment identification
**Yasmina Feriel Djelil**

The study of old paintings, especially rock art, has been transformed by the application of **hyperspectral imaging**. It provides a non-destructive examination of the fine details in the artwork.

Sadly, there hasn't been much use of these methods to research Finnish rock art. This could be because these rock drawings were neglected and only discovered much later. In addition, Finnish rock art is shown on tall rocks, in contrast to other rock paintings seen throughout the world that are typically preserved in caves. This can be explained by the fact that those paintings were made during a period of high ice levels; now that the ice has melted, the paintings are at a higher altitude. As shown in the image below taken by [Ismo Luukkonen](http://www.ismoluukkonen.net/kalliotaide/suomi/index.html), rock art sites in finland are usually difficult to reach.
